## Running Instructions

The game needs MINIX and the LCOM LCF library. Both can be found in [this Virtual Box image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dM32zTzkTUEqNtTwsO-n__XO6r1Y5I-f/view). It is recommended to create a shared directory between both operative systems containing this repository. Finally, to compile and run the game, use the following commands:

```bash
# in the proj/ directory
$ make
$ lcom_run proj
```
